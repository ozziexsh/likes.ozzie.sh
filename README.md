It can be hard for our brains to grasp the numbers that we see everyday on social media. You might be sad that the video you posted only got 30 views, which doesn't initially seem like a lot, but can you imagine if 30 people walked into your bedroom and cheered you on? You'd lose your mind! On the other end of the spectrum: your post goes viral and receives 3 million likes! Do you know what 3 million people looks like? I sure don't.
